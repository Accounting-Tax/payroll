# Establish and Maintain Payroll Systems (2022-23) Summary

## Key Concepts of Single Touch Payroll (STP)

### 1. STP Overview
- A government initiative that requires businesses to digitally report employees' payroll and superannuation data directly to the ATO (Australian Taxation Office) every pay day.
- STP Phase 1 was introduced for businesses with 20 or more employees in 2018 and expanded to smaller businesses in 2019.
- Employees can access their payment summaries (now called "Income Statements") via their myGov account.

### 2. STP Phase 2
- Expansion to include additional data such as income types, reasons for employee terminations, and country codes for employees working overseas.
- Removal of the need for businesses to issue certain tax file number declarations and employment separation certificates, as this data is now incorporated into STP reporting.

### 3. STP Reporting
- Employers must submit payroll reports, including employee wages, PAYG withholding, and superannuation contributions, with every pay run.
- At the end of the financial year, employers make a finalisation declaration to confirm the accuracy of reported data. Employees' income statements are then marked "Tax Ready" in their myGov accounts.

### 4. Year-End Payroll Reconciliation
- Employers must reconcile their payroll records with their ATO submissions before finalising STP reports.
- Key steps include verifying employee details, reconciling superannuation payments, and ensuring correct categorisation of payroll items.

### 5. Employee and Contractor Payments
- Employer must report salary, wages, and superannuation information for employees and certain payments for contractors if they fall under a voluntary agreement.
- Contractor payments not managed via payroll solutions (e.g., through accounts payable) are generally not subject to STP reporting.

### 6. Amendments and Corrections
- Corrections to STP data can be made through an "update event" or during the next pay run.
- If an overpayment or misclassification is detected, employers are required to amend the employee's records and submit updated information to the ATO within 14 days.

### 7. Key STP Definitions
- **Pay Event**: A report submitted each pay day that includes gross salary, PAYG withholding, and superannuation details.
- **Update Event**: A correction submitted outside of a regular pay event to rectify errors in previously reported data.
- **Finalisation Declaration**: A confirmation made at the end of the financial year that all payroll information is correct.

# TD 2021/6: Reasonable Travel and Overtime Meal Allowance (2021–22)

## What This Determination Covers
This determination sets out the reasonable travel and overtime meal allowance expense amounts for employees for the 2021–22 income year.

### Applicable Situations:
- **Overtime meal expenses**: Expenses for food and drink when working overtime.
- **Domestic travel expenses**: For accommodation, food, drink, and incidentals when traveling overnight for work.
- **Overseas travel expenses**: For food, drink, and incidentals during overseas work travel.

### Conditions:
The determination applies when an allowance is received to cover these expenses. If no allowance is received, the determination does not apply.

## Overtime Meal Expenses
- For the 2021–22 income year, the reasonable overtime meal expense is **$32.50**.

### Example 1:
- Samantha, a local government employee, worked overtime and spent $20 on a meal. Since the amount is below the reasonable limit, she can claim a deduction without substantiation.

## Domestic Travel Expenses
- Reasonable amounts are provided for three salary levels for domestic travel:
  - **Salary up to $129,250**
  - **Salary between $129,251 and $230,050**
  - **Salary $230,051 and above**
  
### Categories of Expenses:
- **Accommodation**: Short stays in commercial establishments.
- **Meals**: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner based on the period of travel.
- **Incidentals**: Covers incidental expenses incurred during travel.

### Example 2:
- Svetlana, an accountant, traveled for work and received a meal and incidental allowance. She spent less than the reasonable limit and can claim deductions without substantiation.

## Domestic Travel for Truck Drivers
- Specific reasonable amounts for truck drivers:
  - **Breakfast**: $26.15
  - **Lunch**: $29.85
  - **Dinner**: $51.50

### Example 3:
- Glenn, a truck driver, spent less than the reasonable amount on meals and can claim deductions for the full amount without substantiation.

## Overseas Travel Expenses
- Reasonable amounts for overseas travel depend on salary levels and destination cost groups.

### Example 4:
- Prashant, an employee with a salary of $191,000, travels to China. His total meal and incidental expense is less than the reasonable amount, allowing him to claim the deduction without substantiation.

## Date of Effect
- This determination applies to the 2021–22 income year only.
