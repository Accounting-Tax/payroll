# Establish and Maintain Payroll Systems (2022-23) Summary

## Key Concepts of Single Touch Payroll (STP)

### 1. STP Overview
- A government initiative that requires businesses to digitally report employees' payroll and superannuation data directly to the ATO (Australian Taxation Office) every pay day.
- STP Phase 1 was introduced for businesses with 20 or more employees in 2018 and expanded to smaller businesses in 2019.
- Employees can access their payment summaries (now called "Income Statements") via their myGov account.

### 2. STP Phase 2
- Expansion to include additional data such as income types, reasons for employee terminations, and country codes for employees working overseas.
- Removal of the need for businesses to issue certain tax file number declarations and employment separation certificates, as this data is now incorporated into STP reporting.

### 3. STP Reporting
- Employers must submit payroll reports, including employee wages, PAYG withholding, and superannuation contributions, with every pay run.
- At the end of the financial year, employers make a finalisation declaration to confirm the accuracy of reported data. Employees' income statements are then marked "Tax Ready" in their myGov accounts.

### 4. Year-End Payroll Reconciliation
- Employers must reconcile their payroll records with their ATO submissions before finalising STP reports.
- Key steps include verifying employee details, reconciling superannuation payments, and ensuring correct categorisation of payroll items.

### 5. Employee and Contractor Payments
- Employer must report salary, wages, and superannuation information for employees and certain payments for contractors if they fall under a voluntary agreement.
- Contractor payments not managed via payroll solutions (e.g., through accounts payable) are generally not subject to STP reporting.

### 6. Amendments and Corrections
- Corrections to STP data can be made through an "update event" or during the next pay run.
- If an overpayment or misclassification is detected, employers are required to amend the employee's records and submit updated information to the ATO within 14 days.

### 7. Key STP Definitions
- **Pay Event**: A report submitted each pay day that includes gross salary, PAYG withholding, and superannuation details.
- **Update Event**: A correction submitted outside of a regular pay event to rectify errors in previously reported data.
- **Finalisation Declaration**: A confirmation made at the end of the financial year that all payroll information is correct.
